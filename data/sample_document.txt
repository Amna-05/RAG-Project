    This is a comprehensive test document for our RAG system.
    
    Section 1: Introduction
    Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combines the power of large language models 
    with external knowledge bases to provide more accurate and contextual responses.
    
    Section 2: Components
    The main components of a RAG system include:
    1. Document processing and chunking
    2. Embedding generation for semantic search
    3. Vector database for efficient storage and retrieval
    4. Query processing and similarity matching
    5. Context-aware response generation
    
    Section 3: Benefits
    RAG systems offer several advantages over traditional approaches:
    - Up-to-date information from external sources
    - Reduced hallucination in AI responses
    - Ability to cite sources and provide references
    - Scalable knowledge base that can be updated independently
    
    This document will be processed into multiple chunks for testing purposes.
    Each chunk should maintain context while being appropriately sized for embedding.
